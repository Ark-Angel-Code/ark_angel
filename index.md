## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

<strong>The FIRST but NOT the LAST</strong><br>
This my first website in my GitHub repository.Now That I am set up on GitHub,I'll keep updating my profile repository with the skills which I have and will acquire!
I am publishing this for now!!

<strong>Personal Introduction:</strong><br>
I have always had a fascination for Computer machines and their complexity of work.
This world of magic used to be so great and unfathomable when I was a kid,just playing around with basic Java Coding, Video Games and meddling with Computer hardware.My love for computers has always been unbounded.<br>
Well now, I am pursuing Electronics And Communication Engineering but I have always been a Computer Science guy.From my engineering I found out how the hardware behind any electronics works from normal use of Logic gates to complex embedded systems.Due to my course in electronics which had less emphasis on coding,had rusted up my coding skills.But with a bit of dedication and time I am trying to polish them up back to speed! I got into the right kind of sources and found out about the languages needed to develop Webpages.I was really shocked to see the reality of how actual web developers code and how something which seemed impossible and magical to me was something so simple.Don't misinterpret my words please! In no way that I am saying coding is an easy task!!It seemed simple because I had prior coding knowledge as I had opted for Computer Science And Applications in school. But I had the thought that it would be something more!! Well now that it's gone,it feels really good to be back in the game!<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">Keep on having fun with coding Everyone!<br>Peace out!</p>
